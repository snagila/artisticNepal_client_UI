          <h3>Nepali Art: A Brief Overview</h3>
          <span>
            Nepali art is a rich blend of Hindu, Buddhist, and indigenous
            traditions, reflecting the countryâ€™s cultural diversity. It began
            during the Lichhavi period (5th-8th century) with intricate stone
            and metal sculptures. The Malla era (12th-18th century) was a golden
            age, renowned for stunning temples, woodcarvings, and the
            development of paubha paintings, the precursor to Tibetan thangkas.

            In the 19th century, Western influences merged with traditional
            styles, leading to modern developments. Today, Nepali art continues
            to thrive, balancing its ancient heritage with contemporary
            innovation.
